# IEEE Hackathon, April 2024;

We have made a budgeting tool using machine learning. We have trained 4 ML models which predict the inflation rate, your expected salary, expected BSE return and gold returns for the entered financial year.You can predict your expense in the entered finacial year with the help of inflation model. You can make your debt repayment plan by entering your debt amount, interest rate and time. It will give you the principal amount to pay, interest amount and your savings based on your salary and expence. You will get investment recommendations plan based on the gold and bse returns for the entered finacial year using the gold and bse prediction model and hence you can diversify portfolio according to the savings calculated by the model.
